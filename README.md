Part 1 - WeatherPy

Three observable trends:

1. The relationship between maximum temperature on 4-1-20 and the citiesâ€™ relative distance from the equator is parabolic, with a greater incremental decrease in max temp the farther one is from the equator.
2. With the exception of a few outliers, the wind speed in both hemispheres is congregated in between 0 - 20 mph on 4/1/20. 
3. Conversely, while there is more variety of responses when it comes to humidity, it tends to be distributed in the 60%+ humidity, at least on 4/1/20.
